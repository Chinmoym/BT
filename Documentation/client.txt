Client Operation
	Here the client send server with some predefined commands to control the behaviour
	of a sensor device. The user is prompted to enter different command.
	
	Commands 
		1. detectall
		syntax: detectall 
		This receives a list of addresses of devices connected to I2C bus in server.  
		Ex.[83,119].
	
		2. getinfo (device_address)
		syntax: getinfo
			enter the device_Address 
		This receives register information of the device_address specified

		3. readfrom (device_address,register_address)
		syntax: readfrom
			enter device_address
			enter register_address
		This receives the value read from <register_address> of <device_address>.
		Ex. readfrom(0x53, 0x1E) returns value of x_offset register of ADXL345 from server.
		Error: If the <device_address> is not connected, server returns "No Device found".
 
		4. writeto(device_address,register_address,value)
		syntax: writeto
			enter device_address
			enter register_address
			enter value to be written
		This writes the <value> to <register_address> of <device_address>.
		Ex. writeto(0x53, 0x1E, 32) updates the value of x_offset register of ADXL345 to 32 in server.
		Error: If <device_address> is not connected, server returns "No Device Found".
	
		5. quit:
		syntax: quit
		This closes the client operation/sockets at both end.
