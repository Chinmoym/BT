Dependencies

/*This section covers the dependencies for the Bluetooth code to work*/

1. Enable the Bluetooth hardware in the CHIP Pro
	-> the initial module that we compiled with the kernel didn't worked so we changed our source to enable the BT hardware. 
	-> we used the following git repository
		https://github.com/guh/rtl8723ds_bt.git
	-> instruction to work with the above git repo
		for on CHIP compilation (for on chip compilation we need the kernel build features so you need to install the build tools)
		git clone https://github.com/guh/rtl8723ds_bt.git
		git checkout debian
		sudo make
		sudo make install
		sudo start-rtl-bluetooth (run this process in background / add it to system startup)

		for cross compilation
			compile with regular compilation method and then copy the following 
		#     your path				#device path
		cp -p firmware/rtl8723d_fw 		/lib/firmware/rtlbt
		cp -p firmware/rtl8723d_config 		/lib/firmware/rtlbt
		cp -p rtk_hciattach 			/sbin/
		cp -p scripts/start-rtl-bluetooth	/sbin/

2. Install Python and PyBluez library in the CHIP to access the BT h/w functionality
				
3. Adding services to the BT (follow the below steps) this is a one time setup
	-> open file "/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service" or "/etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service"
	-> Change Line "ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd" to "ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat" 
	-> restart the CHIP
	-> sudo chmod 777 /var/run/sdp
	-> sdptool add SP
	-> sdptool browse local --- to check whether your service is added or not

4. To make the device discoverable by other add the following
	sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan

5. Add the I2C adafruit library for python:
	https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO

6. To enable SPI,
	Add device tree source files in /arch/arm/boot/dts :
		https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/building-spi-into-the-chip-pro-kernel/16159
	Inatall CHIP_IO library from :
		https://github.com/xtacocorex/CHIP_IO
	This has SPI overlaymanager and GPIO related functions.
